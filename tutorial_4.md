Form Templates and Reactive Forms

build simple form
types of forms
Control Form and FormGroup one to one mapping for <form> --> FormGroup and each element have one to one mapping for FormControl class

FormGroup and FormControl
Two Way Directive or Code

unsuscribe

Let's build our own Observable HTTP
Observable.create

Rxjs Map Operator

Consuming httpservice
CRUD operation
extract reusable data service

Authentication and Authorization

Redux with ngrx
Unit Testing and Integration Testing
Deployment
